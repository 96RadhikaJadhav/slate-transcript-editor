TODO: only working in Chrome, not working in Firefox, and Safari - OSX
if selecting text, not showing selection
Commented out because it means cannot select speakers and timecode anymore
which is the intended default behavior but needs to come with export
functionality to export as plain text, word etc.. otherwise user won't be able
to get text out of component with timecodes and speaker names in the interim */
